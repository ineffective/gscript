Next step:
----------
 - perform jumps using labels (label is a node that does not emit any code but defines name and position in code)
 - maybe allow for assembler
 - check for "break" outside of loops and switch/case
 - allow for variable scopes

Short term goals:
-----------------
 - add typechecking dammit!
 - allow for variable arguments count (requires support for arrays (or lists, but i think arrays))
 - data structure: set

Long term goals:
----------------
 - add objects with fields and methods
   - objects should have private/protected/public fields - or maybe not
 - partial application
